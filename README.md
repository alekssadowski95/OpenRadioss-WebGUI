# OpenRadioss-WebGUI
Run and visualize FEM simulations from Abaqus/ Calculix *.inp files.

Quickly get started with OpenRadioss and open-source dynamic simulations. The OpenRadioss-WebGUI combines :
- OpenRadioss solver
- 3D WebWiewer VTK for unstructured meshes (based on three.js)
- Web-framework based on Flask (Webapp)
- Desktop-app deployment 
- Integrated EV platform crash simulation example for teaching students
- Immediate results, while simulation is still running
- Compatible with a fully open-source workflow (FreeCAD + PrePoMax + OpenRadioss)
- Multi-core support out of the box (MPI)
