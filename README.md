# OpenRadioss-WebGUI
Run and visualize dynamic FEM simulations from Abaqus/ Calculix *.inp files with the explicit open-source OpenRadioss solver.

## Overview
Quickly get started with OpenRadioss and open-source dynamic simulations. The OpenRadioss-WebGUI combines :
- OpenRadioss solver
- 3D WebWiewer VTK for unstructured meshes (based on three.js)
- Web-framework based on Flask (Webapp)
- Desktop-app deployment 
- Integrated dynamic, explicit simulation examples for teaching students
- Immediate results, while simulation is still running
- Compatible with a fully open-source workflow (FreeCAD + PrePoMax + OpenRadioss)
- Multi-core support out of the box (MPI)
  
## Getting started
1. Create CAD geometry in FreeCAD
2. Pre-Processing with PrePoMax
3. Solve and visualize with OpenRadioss-WebGUI

### 1. CAD Geometry in FreeCAD

## Applications of dynamic-explicit simulations using OpenRadioss
Applications of simulations performed using this software, specifically featuring plastic deformation and fracture. These case studies will be integrated into the OpenRadioss-WebGUI:
- EV platform EuroNCAP full-width crash simulation
- ISS space particle impact
- Mars Rover drop-off simulation on mars surface and suspension test
- EV Battery pack impact in a crash
- Deformation and stress of a compressed flat silicone gasket from a hydrogen fuel cell (PEMFC)
  
## Fully open-source workflow for crash simulations
The OpenRadioss-WebGUI simplifies the open-source workflow for crash simulations, that we have developed and validated by combining OpenRadioss with a Post-processing solution, reducing the number of software packages(FreeCAD + PrePoMax + OpenRadioss + ParaView) -> (FreeCAD + PrePoMax + OpenRadioss-WebGUI).

## Development of GUI 2.0
To make it even easier to get started, the GUI will be further simplified, while offering more information.
